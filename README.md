## Group Project
Definition: Group projects are collaborative assignments where multiple individuals work together to achieve a common goal or complete a task. In the context of programming, this often involves developing software, solving problems, or creating solutions as a team.
Key Aspects: Effective communication, division of tasks, project management, version control, and teamwork are essential for the success of group projects.
Challenges: Managing conflicting ideas, coordinating schedules, ensuring code consistency, and achieving a shared vision can be challenges in group projects.

### GitHub
- There should be one project repository per group. The other members do not fork or clone the project to ensure only one of the team has the repository in their GitHub account; otherwise, you risk scoring 0%
